## Requirements
- You will solve one of the problems below using simple feature-driven development
- Your program must provide a menu-driven console-based user interface. Implementation details are up to you
- Implementation must employ layered architecture and classes

### For week 8 (25% of grade)
- Implement features 1 and 2
- Have at least 20 procedurally generated items in your application at startup
- Provide specification and tests for all non-UI classes and methods for the first functionality
- Implement and use your own exception classes.

### For week 9 (25% of grade)
- Implement features 3 and 4
- Implement **PyUnit test cases**

### For week 10 (50% of grade)
- All features must be implemented

## Bonus possibility (0.1p, deadline week 10)
- 95% unit test code coverage for all modules except the UI (use *PyCharm Professional*, the *[coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.3/)* or other modules)

## Bonus possibility (0.2p, deadline week 10)
- Implement a graphical user interface, in addition to the required menu-driven UI. Program can be started with either UI, without changing the source code.

### 5. Activity Planner
The following information is stored in a personal activity planner:
- **Person**: `person_id`, `name`, `phone_number`
- **Activity**: `activity_id`, `person_id` - list, `date`, `time`, `description`

Create an application to:
1. Manage persons and activities. The user can add, remove, update, and list both persons and activities.
2. Add/remove activities. Each activity can be performed together with one or several other persons, who are already in the userâ€™s planner. Activities must not overlap (user cannot have more than one activity at a given time).
3. Search for persons or activities. Persons can be searched for using name or phone number. Activities can be searched for using date/time or description. The search must work using case-insensitive, partial string matching, and must return all matching items.
4. Create statistics:
    - Activities for a given date. List the activities for a given date, in the order of their start time.
    - Busiest days. This will provide the list of upcoming dates with activities, sorted in ascending order of the free time in that day (all intervals with no activities).
    - Activities with a given person. List all upcoming activities to which a given person will participate.
5. Unlimited undo/redo functionality. Each step will undo/redo the previous operation performed by the user. Undo/redo operations must cascade and have a memory-efficient implementation (no superfluous list copying).
