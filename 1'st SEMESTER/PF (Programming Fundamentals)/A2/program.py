# Write the implementation for A2 in this file
#

# UI section
# (write all functions that have input or print statements here). 
# Ideally, this section should not contain any calculations relevant to program functionalities

print('Hello A2e1')

# Function section
# (write all non-UI functions in this section)
# There should be no print or input statements below this comment
# Each function should do one thing only
# Functions communicate using input parameters and their return values

# print('Hello A2'!) -> prints aren't allowed here!
