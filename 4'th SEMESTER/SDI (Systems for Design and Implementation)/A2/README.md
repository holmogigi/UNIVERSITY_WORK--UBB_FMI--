# Lab 2 assignment

----

- Add at least 2 more entities with at least `5` attributes each: you should have at least `3` entities in total.
- Add a **1 to many** relation between two of your entities. Some of the entities can be unrelated, but be prepared to also add a many to many relation soon. Choose your entities accordingly.
- Add storage to a database if you don't already have it: any database type is allowed. Rerunning the application should keep previously existing data. It's ok if changes to the data model drops and recreates the database (you do not need migrations yet).
- Implement CRUD for at least one more entity and filtering on a numeric field for at least one entity. The filtering should return all entities with the numeric field higher than a given value.
- Have a REST API usable in Postman.
