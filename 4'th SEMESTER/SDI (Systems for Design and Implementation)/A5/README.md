## Lab 5 assignment

You will need to:
- Add a frontend to your REST API. It should be a Single Page Application (SPA). You can choose any frontend framework or library that lets you create SPAs: React, Angular, Vue etc. It should be something that is under active development.
- Add Swagger to your REST API. It should be publicly accessible.
- Implement at least one CRUD and one filter / statististical report on the frontend.
- Users should be able to navigate the interface without manually editing the URL. The interface should also be intuitive and self-explanatory: if you need to explain it to your lab teacher, it's not good enough.
- Deploy the frontend either on https://www.netlify.com/ (or equivalent) or on your virtual machine. If you choose netlify or equivalent, it should deploy automatically when you commit to github.
- Try to make it look nice and user friendly by adding a UI Components Library like Material UI, Bulma, or even something like Bootstrap, Tailwind etc. This is optional for now, but it will be required later, and you will save time in the long run if you start doing it from the beginning.
