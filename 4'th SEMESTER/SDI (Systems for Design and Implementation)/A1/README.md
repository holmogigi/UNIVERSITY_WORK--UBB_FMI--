Choose any programming language and a **backend** framework and setup a development environment in it. Create an application with CRUD functionalities for a single entity of your choice. The entity should have at least 5 attributes, not counting the ID. You do not need any validations.

Remarks:
- Your application should either expose a REST API (like Django REST Framework, Flask) or a webpage that can be accessed in the browser (like Django)
- Console apps are **not** allowed
- Frontend frameworks / libraries (React, Angular) are **not** allowed
