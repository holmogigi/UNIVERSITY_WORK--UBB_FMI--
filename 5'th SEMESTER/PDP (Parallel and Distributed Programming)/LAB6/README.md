Solve the problem below:

Given a directed graph, find a Hamiltonean cycle, if one exists. Use multiple threads to parallelize the search. Important The search should start from a fixed vertex (no need to take each vertex as the starting point), however, the splitting of the work between threads should happen at several levels, for all possible choices among the neighbors of each current vertex.
