Given a list of BigDecimals
– Compute the sum of the elements using streams
– Compute the average of the elements
– Print the top 10% biggest numbers from the list using streams
– Test the above using unit tests

– Implement the above operations considering Double (as object) and
double (as primitive)
– Compare the performance of these implementations using JMH
• Consider a use case with 100M elements that need to be
processed when designing your code

• Bonus: consider comparing the following scenarios: random
elements, sorted elements (ascending and descending order)
