Statement: Considering a small programming language (that we shall call mini-langauge), write 3 small programs in this language.

Deliverables: p1.* , p2.*, and p3.* and p1err.*  -  small programs written in your programming language  (p1, p2, p3  should be lexically correct; p1err should contain 2 types of lexical errors).
For example: 
p1 and p2: compute de max/min of 3 numbers; verify if a number is prime, compute gcd of 2 numbers, compute the solutions for a 2nd order equation, aso
p3: compute the sum of n numbers, computer the max/min of n numbers


Statement: Considering a small programming language (that we shall call mini-language), you have to write a scanner (lexical analyser)
Task 1: Minilanguage Specification
Deliverables: 
Lexic.txt (file containing mini language lexic description; see example)
token.in (containing the list of all tokens corresponding to the minilanguage)
Syntax.in - the syntactical rules of the language
The minilanguage can be a restricted form of a known programming language, and should contain the following:
- 2 simple data types and a user-defined type
- statements:
- assignment
- input/output
- conditional
- loop
- some conditions will be imposed on the way the identifiers and constants can be formed:
  
i) Identifiers: no more than 256 characters

ii) constants: corresponding to your types
