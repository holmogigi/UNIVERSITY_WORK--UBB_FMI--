PART 3: Deliverables

1. Algorithms corresponding to parsing table (if needed) and parsing strategy

2. Class ParserOutput - DS and operations corresponding to choice (required operations: transform parsing tree into representation; print DS to screen and to file)

Remark: If the table contains conflicts, you will be helped to solve them. It is important to print a message containing row (symbol in LL(1), respectively state in LR(0)) and column (symbol) where the conflict appears. For LL(1), values (Î±,i) might also help.

Run the program and generate: 

- out1.txt (result of parsing if the input was g1.txt); 

- out2.txt (result of parsing if the input was g2.txt)

-messages (if conflict exists/if syntax error exists - specify location if possible)
