Implement in C++ the given container(ADT) using a given representation and a hashtable with a given  collision  resolution(separate  chaining,  coalesced  chaining,  open  addressing)as  a  data  structure. You are not allowed to use any container or data structurefrom STL or from any other library.Do not implement a separate class for the hashtable (or dynamic array, or anything), implement the container directly!The  hashtable  has  to  be  dynamic:  no  matter  what  collision  resolution  has to  be  used,  set  a threshold for αand resize and rehash the table when the actual load factor is higher than α.
