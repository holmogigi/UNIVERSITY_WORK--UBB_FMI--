A coin is tossed 3 times. Let X denote the number of heads that appear.

a) Find the probability distribution function of X. What type of distribution does
X have?

b) Find the cumulative distribution function of X, FX.

c) Find P(X = 0) and P(X 6= 1).

d) Find P(X ≤ 2), P(X < 2).

e) Find P(X ≥ 1), P(X > 1).

f) Write a Matlab code that simulates 3 coin tosses and computes the value of the
variable X.
