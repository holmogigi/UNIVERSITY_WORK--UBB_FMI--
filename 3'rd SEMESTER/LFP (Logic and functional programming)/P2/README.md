a) Define a predicate to add after every element from a list, the divisors of that number

b) For a heterogeneous list, formed from integer numbers and list of numbers, define a predicate to add in every sublist the divisors of every element. Eg: [1, [2, 5, 7], 4, 5, [1, 4], 3, 2, [6, 2, 1], 4, [7, 2, 8, 1], 2] => [1, [2, 5, 7], 4, 5, [1, 4, 2], 3, 2, [6, 2, 3, 2, 1], 4, [7, 2, 8, 2, 4, 1], 2]
